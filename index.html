	<h1 style="text-align:center">Zodiac Signs</h1>
    <p>Zodiac signs were determined based upon celestial observations 
	and the twelve lunar cycles within a single year. These zodiacs can allow us to make predictions
	for certain characteristics a person holds based upon the time of their birth. There are a total 
	of twelve zodiac signs that are unique with their own characteristics. Each sign holds its own 
	traits and patterns as well as strengths and weaknesses. These zodiacs can also be used to predict
	a personâ€™s future. This is called a horoscope. Newspapers and many websites update horoscopes daily.

	<h2 style="text-align:center">Zodiac Dates</h2>
	<p>To determine your zodiac sign, find the sign that's dates correspond with your birthday!
	Notice that the signs do not start with January the 1st. This is because they are based upon
	the Sun's location. This also means that the dates can sometimes be inaccurate because the Sun
	does not always travel at a consistant speed. The dates will only ever be off by a few days at 
	the most. Both positive and negative personality traits that are common for each individual 
	zodiac are also included. These traits are not always true for everyone, so the traits may not
	match your personality perfectly.</p>

	<h3 style="text-align:center">Zodiacs and Their Elements</h3>
	<p>The zodiac signs are sorted into four elements that influence the personality
	traits of each one. The zodiacs are influenced by the <em>energy</em> that comes with each element. 
	The <b>Fire</b> element is the most assertive and temperamental of the elements and can often be 
	seen as a leader. The <b>Water</b> element can be seen as being intuitive and empathetic. Zodiacs 
	that fall under the water element tend to feel their emotions more deeply than the other 
	elements. The <b>Air</b> element is the most social and analytical element. Zodiacs of the air 
	element need to share their ideas and opinions with the rest of the world. Those who align
	with the <b>Earth</b> element tend to be practical and stable. They are the most loyal and
	dependable of the elements.</p>
